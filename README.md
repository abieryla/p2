### P2: Password Generator    

#### Project Description

The purpose of project 2 (P2) is to create a password generator using PHP.
The user can input a number from 0-9 to indicate how many words that he/she
would like the password to consist of. The words will then randomly be taken from the array of words
in the code. The user also has the option to check a box to have a number or special character appear
in the password. There are a few error checking steps that include the number box only allowing 1 space
for the user to input and a step that checks to make sure the user input is actually numeric.
