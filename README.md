### P2: Password Generator    

#### Project Description

P2 includes an index.php page which is linked back to the P1 project page. The purpose of P2 is to 
create a password generator. The user can input a number from 0-9 to indicate how many words he/she
would like the password to consist of. The words will then randomly be taken from the array of words
in the code. The user also has the option to check a box to have a number or special character appear
in the password.
